    <p>This is revision and practise of flexbox</p>
    <!--This one will be a box with 3 columns-->
    <div id="column" class="flex">
        <div class="flex_item">
          The flex-direction is set to column.
        </div>
        <div class="flex_item">
          So the individual items stack from top to bottom.
        </div>
        <div class="flex_item">
          What's slightly confusing is that the outcome looks like 3 rows! But it's also 1 column.
        </div>
      </div>
<br><!--I put the break in to see what's happening more clearly-->
    <!--This one will be a box with 3 rows-->
        <div id="row" class="flex">
        <div class="flex_item">
          The flex-direction is set to row.
        </div>
        <div class="flex_item">
          So the individual items spread from left to right.
        </div>
        <div class="flex_item">
          You can see how this is clearly 1 row.
        </div>

<!--This section is about aligning things within the flexbox. Think flexbox froggy!-->
      <section class="alignItems flexContainer">
        <div class="flexItem">
          There are 3 boxes here, all containing text. This exercise is about positioning of the boxes.
        </div>
        <div class="flexItem">
          It is NOT about positioning of the text within the boxes!
        </div>
        <div class="flexItem">
          The class of alignItems was targeted, then all 3 boxes were set to
          align-items: center so that they appear in the middle
          of the big blue rectangular box's y axis.
        </div>
      </section>
<br><!--I put the break in to see what's happening more clearly-->
      <section class="justifyContent flexContainer">
        <div class="flexItem">
          This is only slightly different, it's about the position of the boxes on the x axis.
        </div>
        <div class="flexItem">
          I set it to justify-content: flex-end.
        </div>
        <div class="flexItem">
          This placed the 3 boxes on the right of the container.
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="perfectlyCentered flexContainer">
        <div class="flexItem">
          To be perfectly centred, you have to set both align-items AND justify-content to center.
        </div>
        </section>
